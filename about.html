    <h1>MangaDL</h1>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>A web downloader for manga hosted on <a href="https://shonenjumpplus.com/">Shonen Jump Plus</a>, <a href="https://www.sunday-webry.com/">Sunday Web Every</a>, and maybe others (the two use the same viewer).</p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>Manga metadata and pages are loaded from their original servers through a CORS proxy (hosted on <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a>). Then, the shuffling of the pages is undone using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">HTML5 Canvas API</a>. Unshuffled pages are zipped (in parallel, as the images are being loaded/processed!) using <a href="https://github.com/101arrowz/fflate/">fflate</a>. The resulting ZIP is saved using <a href="https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/">FileSaver.js</a>.</p>
    <p>This means that all work happens in the client. Nothing is stored server-side.</p>
    <h2>How about support for other sites?</h2>
    <p>I may add support for other sites as I need it. In the meantime, you are more than welcome to create a <a href="https://github.com/lunabunn/mangadl/pulls">PR</a>.</p>
